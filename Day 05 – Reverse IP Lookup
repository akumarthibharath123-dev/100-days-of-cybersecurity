# 📅 Day 5: Server-Side Reconnaissance & Shared Hosting Risks

### 📝 Overview
Today I focused on infrastructure analysis, specifically the risks associated with **Shared Hosting**. I learned that even if a target application is secure, the server it resides on might not be.

### 🔍 Key Concept: The "Bad Neighbor" Effect
On shared hosting environments, hundreds of websites often reside on a single IP address.
* **Technique:** Reverse IP Lookup.
* **Risk:** If one website on the server has a vulnerability (like an outdated plugin or weak upload verification), an attacker can compromise the server root and pivot to other "secure" websites hosted there.

### 🛠️ Tools & Methodology
* **Manual Check:** Used online Reverse IP lookup tools to map domains to a single IP.
* **Automation:** Wrote a script to query DNS records and identify co-hosted domains.
* **Mitigation:** Verified the importance of using VPS or Dedicated instances for critical applications to ensure isolation.

### 🧠 Takeaway
Security is not just about the code you write; it's about the environment where that code lives. Always check your neighbors.
