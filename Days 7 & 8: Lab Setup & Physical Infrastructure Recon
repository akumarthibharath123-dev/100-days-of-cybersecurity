# 📅 Days 7 & 8: Lab Setup & Physical Infrastructure Recon

### 📝 Overview
This section covers the transition from establishing a personal testing ground to understanding the global physical layer of the internet.

### 🛡️ Day 7: Building the Legal Hacking Lab
**Objective:** Establish a controlled, isolated environment for ethical hacking practice.
Key takeway: Professionals never test on live, unauthorized systems. We build sandboxes.

**Tech Stack Explored:**
* **Hypervisors:** VirtualBox / VMware (Type 2 hypervisors for running isolated OSs).
* **Attacker Machine:** Kali Linux or Parrot OS.
* **Victim Machine:** Metasploitable, OWASP Juice Shop (Docker container), or vulnhub VMs.
* **Networking:** Configuring Host-Only or NAT networks to ensure vulnerable machines are not exposed to the actual internet.

### 🌊 Day 8: Submarine Cables & Physical Infrastructure
**Objective:** Understand OSI Layer 1 (Physical) on a global scale.
Key takeaway: The internet is not a vague "cloud"; it is tangible hardware often located in vulnerable physical locations (ocean floors).

**Concepts:**
* **Submarine Cables:** The fiber optic backbone carrying >95% of transoceanic data.
* **Physical Vulnerabilities:** Cable cutting (accidental by ships, or intentional sabotage), tapping points, and landing station security.
* **Resources:** [Submarine Cable Map](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/) - Essential for visualizing global connectivity and choke points.
