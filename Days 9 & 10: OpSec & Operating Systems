# 📅 Days 9 & 10: OpSec & Operating Systems

### 📝 Overview
These two days focused on the setup of the attacker's environment: ensuring anonymity (Day 9) and selecting the correct Operating System distribution (Day 10).

### 👻 Day 9: Proxies & VPNs (Anonymity)
**Objective:** Understand traffic masking and redirection.
* **VPN (Virtual Private Network):** Encrypts all traffic leaving the device. Hides IP from the ISP and target.
* **Proxy:** Intermediary server that forwards requests.
    * *Forward Proxy:* Protects the client (user).
    * *Reverse Proxy:* Protects the server.
    * *Chaining:* Using multiple proxies (e.g., Proxychains) to complicate tracing.

### 🐉 Day 10: Kali Linux vs. Parrot OS
**Objective:** Compare distributions for Pentesting.

| Feature | Kali Linux | Parrot Security OS |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base** | Debian | Debian (Testing Branch) |
| **Resources** | Heavy (GNOME/XFCE) | Lightweight (MATE) |
| **Privacy** | Standard | Built-in "Anonsurf" module |
| **Use Case** | Corporate Pentesting | Low-spec hardware / Privacy |

**Decision:** I have set up [Insert your choice here, e.g., Kali Linux] as my primary driver for this 100-day challenge.
