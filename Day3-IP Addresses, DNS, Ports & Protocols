## Day 3 – IP Addresses, DNS, Ports & Protocols

While analyzing suspicious login activity, I learned the importance of IP addresses in real-world investigations.

### Topics Covered:
- IPv4 and IPv6
- Public vs Private IP ranges
- Domain names and domain structure
- DNS and its role in networking
- Ports and common protocols

### Why This Matters:
Understanding these concepts helps in tracing attackers, identifying services running on a target system, and analyzing how systems communicate over the internet.
  
IPv4 Examples (32-bit)IPv4 addresses are written as four decimal numbers (0-255) separated by dots.
  
Home Router (Private): 192.168.1.1Localhost 
  
(Your own computer): 127.0.0.1Google 
  
Public DNS: 8.8.8.8Broadcast
  
Address: 255.255.255.255Cloudflare
  
DNS: 1.1.1.1IPv6 
  
Examples (128-bit)IPv6 addresses are written as eight groups of four hexadecimal characters (0-9 and a-f) separated by colons.

(Note: The double colon :: replaces the long string of zeros to make it shorter.)
