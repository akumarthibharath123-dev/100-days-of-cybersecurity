# 📅 Day 6: Web Archiving & Digital Forensics

### 📝 Overview
Today's focus was on **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)** and recovering data from defunct or malicious websites. I explored how web archives serve as a "time machine" for digital investigations.

### 🔍 Key Concept: Internet Permanence
When a website is deleted from a server, it is often already indexed by archival crawlers.
* **Tool:** The Wayback Machine (archive.org).
* **Objective:** Retrieve content from a site that returns a 404 error.

### 🛠️ Investigation Steps
1.  **Target:** A (hypothetical) deleted scam website.
2.  **Action:** Input the URL into the Wayback Machine.
3.  **Navigation:** Selected dates prior to the reported takedown.
4.  **Extraction:** Recovered HTML of "About Us" and "Pricing" pages.
5.  **Result:** Preserved text and images used in the fraudulent campaign as evidence.

### 🧠 Takeaway
"Deleting" a website is often just removing the current pointer. The history remains stored in distributed archives. Always check archives during reconnaissance.
