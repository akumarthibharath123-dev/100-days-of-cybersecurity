# 📅 Days 11 & 12: Privacy Tools & Network Scanners

### 🧅 Day 11: Tor Browser Installation
**Objective:** Establish an anonymized browsing environment.
* **Concept:** Onion Routing (Traffic jumps through Entry -> Middle -> Exit nodes).
* **Installation (Linux):**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install tor torbrowser-launcher
    torbrowser-launcher
    ```
* **Usage:** Accessing `.onion` hidden services and bypassing censorship.

### 🗺️ Day 12: Nmap (Network Mapper)
**Objective:** Install and run basic network scans.
* **Concept:** Port Scanning (identifying open "doors" on a computer).
* **Installation (Linux):**
    ```bash
    sudo apt install nmap
    ```
* **Key Flags:**
    * `-sS`: SYN Scan (Stealthy, fast).
    * `-sV`: Version Detection (Finds out what software version is running).
    * `-O`: OS Detection (Guesses the operating system).
