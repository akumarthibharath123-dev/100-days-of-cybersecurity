# Day 2 – Types of Hackers

Understanding hacker classifications is fundamental to cybersecurity.

## Types of Hackers

### White Hat Hackers
Authorized professionals who legally test systems to find and fix vulnerabilities.

### Black Hat Hackers
Criminal attackers who exploit systems for profit, data theft, or disruption.

### Gray Hat Hackers
Operate without permission but may disclose vulnerabilities. Still illegal.

### Script Kiddies
Inexperienced users who rely on ready-made tools without understanding impact.

### Hacktivists
Attack systems to promote political or social causes.

### State-Sponsored Hackers
Government-backed groups conducting espionage or cyber warfare.

## Key Takeaway
Skill does not define a hacker — **intent and authorization do**.
